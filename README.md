Eyes that follow
> Version 0.1


## Project Name: Eye movement

## Description:
Eye movement is an animation exercise where the eye balls follow the cursor in every direction just as two normal eyes would.
Eye movement.<br />Move the mouse around. Try to escape if you can!

## Installation:
Just clone the repository. Then use the index.html on any browser.

## Usage:
Free to use

## Support:
Akhila Kulkarni

## Future Improvements
In future I plan to add a full face where this animation would feel a little more complete with the face expressions as well.
